  <b>Temply</b> allows you to create text templates to use in inline mode.

  Create a template with /newtemplate, then start typing <code>@temply_bot *template name*</code> in any chat and select the template to be instantly sent there. If you don't like a template you can also delete it with /deletetemplate. Language can be changed with the /language command. You can select whether to show web previews for templates or not by calling /preview. You can also add text to existing templates by using /appendtemplate.

  If you have any questions, please, read through @borodutch_support.

  Also check out another one of my projects — <a href="https://todorant.com">Todorant</a> (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/todorant/id1482078243">iOS</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.todorant">Android</a>). It is a smart todo list app that uses cognitive psychology to trick your brain into finishing projects and showing results. It's free for 30 days with no strings attached, so go give it a shot if you want to improve your productivity. It helped me — it can help you as well.
