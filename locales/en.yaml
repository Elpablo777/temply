  <b>Temply</b> allows you to create text templates to use in inline mode.

  Create a template with /newtemplate, then start typing <code>@temply_bot *template name*</code> in any chat and select the template to be instantly sent there. If you don't like a template you can also delete it with /deletetemplate. Language can be changed with the /language command. You can select whether to show web previews for templates or not by calling /preview.
